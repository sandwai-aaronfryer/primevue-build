# Sandwai's Fork Of PrimeVue

## Building

To build run `npm run build-lib`

## Changes

-   Stripped down `resolveFieldData` in `ObjectUtils.js` to increase display/sort/search speed.
-   Removed `DomHandler.clearSelection` from `onRowRightClick` in `DataTable.vue` to allow copying data from DataTable fields.
